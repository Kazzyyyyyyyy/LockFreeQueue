# MemoryAllocator
MCMP LockFreeQueues, one with LinkedLists and one with arrays

# State of the project 
The project is not done at all. I thought, I understood it all, but I really didnt. There is a lot, I still have to learn abt the subject. 

# Update
After a one week break, because I had no time, im on it again. 

The first time in my coding journey, the dunning kruger effect hit me, and that with full force.
But I learned from it, and im now back, doing it all over again, while actually understanding it.
