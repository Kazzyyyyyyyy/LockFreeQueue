# MemoryAllocator
MCMP LockFreeQueues, one with LinkedLists and one with arrays

# What I've learned 
 - atomic datatypes/operations 
 - using threads/multithreading
 - what to look out for when working with threads 
 - concept of LockFree datastructures
 - writing thorough tests for my own code
 
# Implemented Queues
 - LinkedList 
 - Array

# State of the project 
The project is done. I tested both Queues overnight with selfwritten tests and both showed no problems/bugs. Im very happy with how it turned out. 
The code is clean and functional. The only thing I could still do, is clean up the test-class for the ArrayQueue, but I dont really see any reason in doing it.
I showed that I can write clean / clean up messy code. Cleaning up this code too, would take another 1 or 2h and nobody is going too look at it again either way.

# Notes 
This is a pure learning project for me, same as all my other projects. I dont give any waranty that the queues actually work in any use case.
